The critically acclaimed episode \"Ozymandias\" references the Percy Bysshe Shelley poem of the same name, which describes the crumbling legacy of an overly prideful king. The episode draws parallels to the poem, as both antiheroes are left with little to show for their empire-building efforts. Austin Gill of Xavier University stated the episode \"evokes the tyrannical aspirations of invincibility and arrogance of Ozymandias himself as represented in Shelley\\'s poem\".
